Available ellipsoids
====================

These are the available ellipsoids and their corresponding defining parameters.

All ellipsoids are instances of the :class:`~boule.Ellipsoid`,
:class:`~boule.Sphere`, or :class:`~boule.TriaxialEllipsoid` classes. See the
class documentations for a list their derived physical properties (attributes)
and computations/transformations that they can perform (methods).
