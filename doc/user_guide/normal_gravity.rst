Normal gravity
==============

One of the main uses for ellipsoids in geodesy and geophysics is the
computation of :term:`normal gravity` (usually represented by :math:`\gamma`).
The exact calculation and underlying assumptions are a bit different between
the different types of ellipsoids.

Oblate ellipsoids
-----------------

Method :meth:`boule.Ellipsoid.normal_gravity` performs the normal gravity
calculations.
It can operate on single values:

.. jupyter-execute::

    import boule as bl

    gamma = bl.WGS84.normal_gravity(latitude=45, height=50)
    print(f"{gamma:.2f} mGal")

Or on numpy array-like data (including ``pandas.DataFrame`` and
``xarray.DataArray``):

.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np

    height = np.linspace(0, 1000, 10)
    gamma = bl.WGS84.normal_gravity(latitude=45, height=height)
    print(gamma)

The arrays can be multi-dimensional so we can use :mod:`verde` to generate a
grid of normal gravity:

.. jupyter-execute::

    import verde as vd

    longitude, latitude = vd.grid_coordinates(
        region=[0, 360, -90, 90], spacing=0.5,
    )
    gamma = bl.WGS84.normal_gravity(latitude=latitude, height=10_000)
    print(gamma)

Which can be put in a :class:`xarray.Dataset`:

.. jupyter-execute::

    grid = vd.make_xarray_grid(
        (longitude, latitude), gamma, data_names="normal_gravity",
    )
    grid

And plotted with :mod:`pygmt`:

.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   # Needed so that displaying works on jupyter-sphinx and sphinx-gallery at
   # the same time. Using PYGMT_USE_EXTERNAL_DISPLAY="false" in the Makefile
   # for sphinx-gallery to work means that fig.show won't display anything here
   # either.
   import pygmt
   pygmt.set_display(method="notebook")

.. jupyter-execute::

    import pygmt

    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    fig.grdimage(grid.normal_gravity, projection="W20c", cmap="viridis")
    fig.basemap(frame=["af", "WEsn"])
    fig.colorbar(position="JCB+w10c", frame=["af", 'y+l"mGal"', 'x+l"WGS84"'])
    fig.show()


.. admonition:: Did you notice?
    :class: note

    The calculations were performed at a non-zero height without the need for a
    free-air correction. That's because
    method :meth:`boule.Ellipsoid.normal_gravity` implements the closed-form
    formula of [Lakshmanan1991]_ and [LiGotze2001]_ instead of the classic
    Somigliana equation.
    This allows us to calculate normal gravity precisely at any height above
    the ellipsoid **without the need for a free-air correction**, which is
    particularly useful for geophysics.

These calculations can be performed for any oblate ellipsoid (see
:ref:`ellipsoids`). Here is an example for the normal gravity of the Martian
ellipsoid:

.. jupyter-execute::

    gamma_mars = bl.Mars2009.normal_gravity(latitude=latitude, height=10_000)

    grid_mars = vd.make_xarray_grid(
        (longitude, latitude), gamma_mars, data_names="normal_gravity",
    )

    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    fig.grdimage(grid_mars.normal_gravity, projection="W20c", cmap="lajolla")
    fig.basemap(frame=["af", "WEsn"])
    fig.colorbar(position="JCB+w10c", frame=["af", 'y+l"mGal"', 'x+l"Mars"'])
    fig.show()


Notice that the overall trend is the same as for the Earth (the Martian
ellipsoid is slightly more oblate than Earth) but the range of values
is different. The mean
gravity on Mars is much weaker than on the Earth: around 370,000 mGal or 3.7
m/s² when compared to 970,000 mGal or 9.7 m/s² for the Earth.

The computations of the gravimetric quantities in boule are accurate for oblate
ellipsoids with flattenings that are arbitrarily small. In fact, even a
flattening of zero is permissible. Whereas the standard textbook equations
become numerically unstable when the flattening is less than about
:math:`10-^{-7}`, boule makes use of approximate equations in the low flattening
limit that do not suffer any numerical limitations.

.. admonition:: Assumptions for oblate ellipsoids
    :class: important

    Normal gravity of oblate ellipsoids is calculated under the following
    assumptions:

    * The :term:`gravity potential` is constant on the surface of the ellipsoid.
    * The internal density structure is unspecified but must lead to a constant
      potential at the surface.

    **Important:** A homogeneous density ellipsoid **does not** satisfy the
    condition of constant potential at the surface. See [Karcol2017]_ for a
    thorough discussion.


Spheres
-------

Method :meth:`boule.Sphere.normal_gravity` performs the normal gravity
calculations for spheres. This method behaves mostly the same as the oblate
ellipsoid version, with two exceptions. First, spherical coordinates are
used in the case of a sphere, and the latitude coordinate corresponds to
*geocentric spherical latitude*. Geodetic and spherical latitude are, in fact,
the same for an ellipsoid with zero flattening.

Second, boule makes the assumption that the interior density distribution of
the planet varies only as a function of radius. Because of this, the normal
gravitation potential is constant on the sphere surface, but the normal gravity
potential (which includes the centrifugal potential) is not.

One planetary object that makes use of the Sphere class is the Moon. This
example computes the normal gravity of the Moon at 45 degrees latitude
and for heights between 0 and 1 km above the reference radius.

.. jupyter-execute::

    gamma = bl.Moon2015.normal_gravity(latitude=45, height=height)
    print(gamma)

This is what the normal gravity of Moon looks like in map form, 10 km above
the surface:

.. jupyter-execute::

    gamma = bl.Moon2015.normal_gravity(latitude=latitude, height=10_000)

    grid = vd.make_xarray_grid(
        (longitude, latitude), gamma, data_names="normal_gravity",
    )

    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    fig.grdimage(grid.normal_gravity, projection="W20c", cmap="lapaz")
    fig.basemap(frame=["af", "WEsn"])
    fig.colorbar(position="JCB+w10c", frame=["af", 'y+l"mGal"', 'x+l"Moon"'])
    fig.show()

.. admonition:: Assumptions for spheres
    :class: important

    Normal gravity of spheres is calculated under the following assumptions:

    * The :term:`gravitational potential` is constant on the surface of the
      ellipsoid.
    * The internal density structure is unspecified but must be either
        homogeneous or vary only as a function of radius (e.g., in concentric
        layers).
    * The normal gravity is the magnitude of the gradient of the :term:`gravity
      potential` of the sphere.

      **Important:** Unlike an ellipsoid, the normal gravity potential of a
      sphere is not constant on its surface, and the normal gravity vector is
      not perpendicular to the surface.


Gravity versus gravitation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Notice that the variation of the normal gravity between the poles and equator
for the Moon is much smaller than for the Earth or Mars.
That's because the **variation is due solely to the centrifugal acceleration**,
and the angular rotation rate of the Moon is small.

We can see this clearly when we calculate the **normal gravitation** (without
the centrifugal component) using :meth:`boule.Sphere.normal_gravitation`:

.. jupyter-execute::

    gravitation = bl.Moon2015.normal_gravitation(
        height=np.full_like(latitude, 10_000)
    )
    grid = vd.make_xarray_grid(
        (longitude, latitude), gravitation, data_names="normal_gravitation",
    )
    grid

Since there is no centrifugal acceleration, the normal gravitation is due
solely to the mass of a sphere and depends only on the height above the sphere
and not latitude.

.. tip::

   For spherical bodies it can often be better to use
   :meth:`boule.Sphere.normal_gravitation` since services like the
   `ICGEM <http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/home>`__ offer the ability to generate
   grids of observed gravitation (without the centrifugal component).
