About
-----

*Boule* is Python library for representing `Reference Ellipsoids
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ellipsoid>`__, calculating their
gravity fields, and converting coordinates defined on the ellipsoids.

The main use cases are:

* Calculating normal gravity (for gravity anomalies and disturbances).
* Spherical gravity modeling, which requires geodetic to geocentric spherical
  coordinate conversions.
* Input ellipsoid parameters for spherical harmonic analysis.

Boule is French for "ball" and also a `traditional shape of bread resembling a
squashed ball <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boule_(bread)>`__ (much like the
Earth).


Project goals
-------------

* Provide a representation of ellipsoid parameters and derived quantities,
  including units and citations.
* Convert between geodetic coordinates and geocentric spherical, topocentric,
  etc.
* Calculate the gravity, gravitational, and centrifugal potential (and its
  derivatives) of ellipsoids in closed form.
* Include a range ellipsoids for the Earth and other planetary bodies.

Imposter syndrome disclaimer

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute.
What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equally important contributions include:
writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or implementing tests, or
even giving feedback about the project (including giving feedback about the
contribution process).
If you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, you might see the errors and
assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.
If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from
those mistakes.
That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
